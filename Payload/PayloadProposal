Payload Project Proposal goes here


GPS/Altimeter for flight tracking. Gyroscope for rocket orientation tracking. 
  Make 3D models of flight path
  Compare to simulations
  Use different altimeters to compare data
  Featherweight GPS tracker

Adafruit 9-DOF Absolute Orientation IMU Fusion Breakout - BNO055
  Capable of meeting our flight tracking needs and more. 

Multiple Cameras for 360 degree viewing angles.

Geiger Counter
  Sounds cool
