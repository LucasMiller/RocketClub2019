Payload Project Proposal goes here


GPS/Altimeter for flight tracking. Gyroscope for rocket orientation tracking. 
  make 3D models of flight path
  Compare to simulations
  Deploy army toy soldier with parachute & measure final velocity
Multiple Cameras for 360 degree viewing angles.



Geiger Counter
